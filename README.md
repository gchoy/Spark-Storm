#Introduction
In this data engineering project we tested two processing frameworks: Spark streaming and Storm. The two main goals were:
- To understand the differences between Spark Streaming and Storm.
- Test the processing frameworks under different loads and measure throughput.
- **Testing Conditions:** Tests on each framework were not run concurrently, that is only one framework was tested at a time.
- **Metrics to be measured:** Amount of data processed (load) and records per second (throughput).
- **Caveat:** The results obtained must be taken with precaution due to processing and semantic differences between Spark streaming and Storm.       

#Data 
The data was generated by a producer that selected words from a list and created a comma separated string which was streamed through Kafka to a consumer in spark.

#Cluster Setup

A distributed AWS cluster of four ec2 m3.medium nodes were used. The  ingestion components, and processing frameworks were configured and run in distributed mode, with one master and three workers for Spark streaming, and one nimbus and three servers for Storm.

#Instructions to Set up this Pipeline

- Spin 4 ec2 nodes, install Hadoop, Zookeeper, Kafka, Spark, and Storm 

- Start Zookeeper and Kafka

- Select which processing framework you want to test, and start it.

- Install python packages:
```sudo pip install kafka-python pyleus ```

- Run the Kafka producer:
```python spark/producer.py```

- Run pyspark script:
```$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit metrics.py```

**Or:**

- Build storm topology:
```pyleus word_topology.yaml```

- Submit pyleus topology:
```pyleus submit -n  52.8.175.21 word_topology.jar```

**Note:** Zookeeper and Kafka must be running before starting the producer, or metrics.py or submiting the Storm topology.
